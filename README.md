# Big Mac Index Predictability: A Statistical Analysis
This project aims to analyze the Big Mac data of 10 countries over a 20-year period (2000-2020) to understand currency valuation trends and devise investment strategies based on the most overvalued and undervalued currencies each year.

Project Objective
The goal of this project is to provide insights into currency valuation trends and potential investment strategies using the Big Mac Index. The Big Mac Index, published by The Economist, is a fun measure of purchasing power parity (PPP) between two currencies and provides a test of the extent to which market exchange rates result in goods costing the same in different countries.

Outcomes
The analysis revealed that the Swiss Franc was consistently the most overvalued currency over the past 20 years, while the South African Rand was the most undervalued. The study also found that reinvesting annually in the most overvalued currency yielded the highest gains from 2000-2020.
